# RealmExample
Realm example with MVP pattern and clean architecture

Realm is one of the most powerful databases in Android development. Nowadays is :
<ul><li>Inserts: 2x faster than SQLite</li><li>Queries: 7x faster than SQLite</li><li>Counts: 9x than SQLite</li></ul>

Realm is under development, but, it is a good choice for been our application database.

In this example, we have made one example for Realm (insertions, deletions, and queries), with **MVP pattern** and **clean architecture**.
